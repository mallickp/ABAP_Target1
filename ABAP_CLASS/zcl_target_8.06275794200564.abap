To optimize the nested loops and reduce the execution time of the given function modules in ABAP, we can follow the best practices by using CDS views, new language constructs, exception handling, and performance improvements. Let's rewrite the code:

1. Create a CDS view that does the aggregation and retrieves the required columns:

```abap
@AbapCatalog.sqlViewName: 'ZCOLLACT_AGG'
@AbapCatalog.compiler.compareFilter: true
@AbapCatalog.preserveKey: true
@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #CHECK
@EndUserText.label: 'ZCOLLACT Aggregated Data'
define view ZCOLLACT_AGG as select from zcollectoraction as a {
  a.bukrs,
  a.kunnr,
  a.yearmonth,
  max(a.dat) as max_dat,
  max(a.time) as max_time
} group by
  a.bukrs,
  a.kunnr,
  a.yearmonth;
```

2. Use the CDS view in your ABAP code to fetch the data, and replace the nested SELECT with INNER JOIN:

```abap
DATA: wa_collectoraction TYPE zcollectoraction,
      it_collectoraction LIKE STANDARD TABLE OF zcollectoraction.

* Fetch data from CDS view
SELECT z1.bukrs,
       z1.kunnr,
       z1.yearmonth,
       z1.max_dat AS dat,
       z2.time
  INTO CORRESPONDING FIELDS OF TABLE it_collectoraction
  FROM ZCOLLACT_AGG AS z1
  INNER JOIN zcollectoraction AS z2
    ON z2.bukrs = z1.bukrs
   AND z2.kunnr = z1.kunnr
   AND z2.dat   = z1.max_dat
 WHERE z1.bukrs IN so_bukrs
   AND z1.kunnr IN so_kunnr
   AND z1.max_dat IN so_date
   AND z2.time = z1.max_time.
```

3. Replace the nested loop with a simple loop:

```abap
LOOP AT it_collectoraction INTO wa_collectoraction.
  PERFORM progress_bar USING 'Retrieving data...' (035)
                            sy-tabix
                            i_tab_lines.
ENDLOOP.
```

By using CDS views and eliminating nested SELECT and nested LOOPs, we can optimize the performance of the function module and follow the best practices in ABAP.
