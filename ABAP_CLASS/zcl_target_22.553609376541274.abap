The given ABAP code sample looks valid. The class 'ltcl_test_zcl_cnv_2010c' is properly defined with methods for positive and negative test scenarios. There is also an implementation section that contains method implementations for setting up, tearing_down, and testing positive and negative scenarios.

However, as a code-checking AI, I am not able to execute the code and confirm its correctness, so please make sure to test the class in your SAP system for functional correctness in your use case.
